    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>BBQ Chicken Tacos are a favorite healthy and easy dinner at our house. Marinated BBQ chicken is served in a warm tortilla topped with black beans, corn, onion, cilantro, avocado and a creamy cilantro lime sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetables: This is a great meal to clean out the extra veggies in your fridge. We love to add grilled zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, chopped lettuce, or olives.</li>
        <li>Vegetarian: Instead of chicken, marinate extra firm tofu.</li>
        <li>Crockpot: Place chicken in crockpot and cover with bbq sauce. Cook for 3-5 hours on low, or until done. Chop or shred chicken.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make BBQ Chicken Tacos:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate Chicken: Add chicken and â…“ cup BBQ sauce to a ziplock bag. Refrigerate for 1-3 hours.</li>
        <li>Make Creamy Cilantro Lime Sauce by combining all ingredients until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve. The sauce could be made a few days ahead.</li>
        <li>Grill Chicken: Preheat grill and lightly grease with oil or cooking spray. Cook chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side, flipping once, until cooked through, 165 degrees F. Remove to a cutting board, baste with more BBQ sauce, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before chopping.</li>
        <li>Assemble Tacos: Warm tortillas on grill or in a hot dry skillet. Add a spoonful of chopped chicken, corn, black beans, tomatoes and avocado to each warm tortilla. Drizzle chicken tacos with extra bbq sauce, and cilantro lime sauce. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Enjoy!</li>
